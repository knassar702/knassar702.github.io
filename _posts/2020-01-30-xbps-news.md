XBPS 0.58 was just released, with many new features and a lot of improvements.
Since the last post was for 0.54, this post includes all changes and some highlights since the last post.

## Highlights

### Performance improvements

Some users might have noticed that removing the `plasma-desktop` was very time consuming because of dependency cycles.
The dependency resolution algorithm has been completely rewritten and is now able to resolve the dependencies of `plasma-desktop` within seconds.

See the [pull request void-linux/xbps#78](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/78) if you are interested in what changed.

The `--fulldeptree` flag of [xbps-query(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-query.1) in combination with `-x` or `-X` for dependencies and reverse dependencies respectively has been improved and will now be 50x faster in the worst case scenario.

### `ignorepkg` configuration option

Many users tried to get rid of the default kernel or some other `base-system` requirement.
For this we've added a new configuration keyword: `ignorepkg`.

With this new keyword you can ignore packages that are pulled in by other packages as runtime dependencies.

As example you can add `linux-firmware-amd` as ignored package and then uninstall the package:

```
# echo "ignorepkg=linux-firmware-amd" > /etc/xbps.d/10-ignore.conf
# xbps-remove linux-firmware-amd
```

This works for any package, i.e. being able to remove `linux4.19` while keeping the `linux` meta package.
Or removing the `linux` meta package itself and installing only the kernel series you like to use yourself.

### `noextract` configuration option

Another useful new feature is the new `noextract`, it allows to specify patterns of
files that should not be extracted when installing or updating packages.

This allows as example to skip extracting translations the users are not interesting in,
allowing to reduce the installation size.

We plan to make use of it in `xbps-src` to cut down the time required to install build dependencies.

## Download only flag

A new flag was added to [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1) which allows to
download packages and its dependencies without installing them.

## Changelog

### xbps-0.58 (2020-01-30):

 * libfetch: fix [CVE-2020-7450](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:01.libfetch.asc); from FreeBSD. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * [xbps-query(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-query.1), [xbps-remove(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-remove.1): improved detection
   of orphans, needing multiple iterations to collect
   all of them in a single transaction. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-checkvers(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-checkvers.1): added `-e, --removed`.
   To list removed templates in srcpkgs. [[Chocimier]](https://github.com/Chocimier)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): improved `-D, --download-only`.
   This now can be used to download all required
   binary packages of the target pkg without the need
   to have write permission to the `rootdir`.

   ```
   $ xbps-install -c $PWD/cachedir -Dy xbps
   ```

   NOTE: `-c, --cachedir` must be specified as absolute
   pathname, otherwise it will treat it as relative to
   rootdir. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-fetch(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-fetch.1): added `-s` to print sha256sums of
   downloaded files. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * configure: re-add `--enable-debug` and enable it
   by default. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): ignore indirect reverse dependencies
   while updating xbps. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): added `--reproducible` long option.
   If set, enables reproducible mode in pkgdb. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): don't prompt if all packages in
   the transaction are on hold. [Mohamad Barbar]

 * [xbps-rindex(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-rindex.1): stop adding the "build-date" pkg obj.
   Contained wrong info and did not provide enough value
   to be useful; another step towards reproducibility.
   [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-create(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-create.1): always sanitize gathered symlinks. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): do not silently update `xbps` on
   any install/update transaction. If there's a new update
   for the `xbps` package, this needs to be explicitely
   declared as a single transaction, i.e:

	```
	$ xbps-install -u xbps
	```

   Otherwise it will return `EBUSY` (16), making this a proper
   error code to diagnose what failed. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps.d(5)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps.d.5): new 'noextract' configuration option,
   to skip extracting files matching a pattern. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * [xbps.d(5)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps.d.5): autodetected 'architecture' (glibc or musl)
   at compile-time on linux systems. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * configure: added `--enable-lto` and don't enable it
   by default. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * Multiple bugs with packages on hold were fixed. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-uchroot(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-uchroot.1), [xbps-uunshare(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-uunshare.1): document end of
   options argument. [[Doan Tran Cong Danh]](https://github.com/sgn)

 * [xbps-alternatives(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-alternatives.1): prune obsolete alternatives groups. [[q66]](https://github.com/q66)

17 new test cases were added in this release, 6 people
were involved: Juan RP, Piotr WÃ³jcik, Duncan Overbruck,
Doan Tran Cong Danh, Mohamad Barbar, q66.

   fetch code. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * Verify revision in `xbps_pkg_{version,revision,name}`,
   to handle properly package names that use `_`.
   [[Chocimier]](https://github.com/Chocimier)

   [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-alternatives(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-alternatives.1): check if alternative is a
   symlink before removing it. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

   when executing package scripts. [[Gottox]](https://github.com/Gottox)

 * [xbps-rindex(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-rindex.1): better error handling for writing repodata
   archives. [[Chocimier]](https://github.com/Chocimier)

 * [xbps-create(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-create.1): better error handling for writing archives.
   [[Chocimier]](https://github.com/Chocimier)

### xbps-0.57 (2019-08-06):

 * xbps now builds with tcc and pcc. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * xbps now uses the transactional file checks for package removals,
   this fixes issues where xbps removes wrong files, if a package
   replaces another packages with the same files. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * [xbps-remove(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-remove.1): skip the transaction if no packages are found.
   This restores the behaviour of xbps prior to 0.54. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-remove(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-remove.1): fix `-o, --remove-orphans` not removing
   all orphaned packages. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): if specified packages with `-u, --update` are
   up to date return EEXIST. [[jnbr]](https://github.com/jnbr)

   ENXIO because the transaction dictionary wasn't
   initialized before first use. Regression from 0.54. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * Fixed unlocking the pkgdb via `xbps_end()`. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * Fixed flushing pkgdb to storage and re-reading it unnecessarily,
   this affected [xbps-alternatives(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-alternatives.1),
   [xbps-pkgdb(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-pkgdb.1) and
   [xbps-reconfigure(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-reconfigure.1).
   [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * xbps now allows to remove an installed package that was
   added to the ignored packages list with `ignorepkg` from
   [xbps.d(5)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps.d.5). [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * Fixed an issue with multi threaded for each loops
   processing the first slicecount*maxthreads entries twice. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

   fails within the connection delay it aborts with the error
   instead of continuing with the next address. [[jnbr]](https://github.com/jnbr)

### xbps-0.55 (2019-06-21):

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): Added `-D, --download-only` flag to allow

   the transaction even if file conflicts were detected. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1): return 0 if package is already installed,
   or up-to-date if updating, not `EEXIST`. `EEXIST` now is only
   returned if there are file conflicts in transaction. [[xtraeme]](https://github.com/xtraeme)

 * [xbps-checkvers(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-checkvers.1): fixed a segfault with `--format`. [[duncaen]](https://github.com/Duncaen)

 * Fixed a build failure on ppc64. [[q66]](https://github.com/q66)
