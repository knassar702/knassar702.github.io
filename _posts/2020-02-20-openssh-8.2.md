title: OpenSSH 8.2 update requires restart of sshd
layout: post
---

With the OpenSSH update to 8.2 you *must* restart the
`sshd` service, or it will not accept new ssh connections.

XBPS will print a notice about this when updating OpenSSH,
but we hope by posting this notice we will reach the
users who don't read the output of regular updates
and avoid or minimize complications due to the update.

We considered restarting sshd automatically on update,
but the policy of not restarting, enabling or otherwise
interact with services during updates stands.
